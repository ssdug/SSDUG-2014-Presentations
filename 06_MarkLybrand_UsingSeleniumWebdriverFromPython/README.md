"Come and learn how to use Selenium web driver to automate actions against a web site. Selenium web server can be driven from many different languages, including Java, C#, VB.Net, and Ruby.  We will be using Python as our language of choice.  Let's exercise a little BDD and start developing a site. For added enjoyment, the site we will be fleshing out will use the popular Sinatra framework."
