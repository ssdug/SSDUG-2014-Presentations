December Networking
=========================================================================

######Presented on December 11th 2014 @ the Fish Tale Brew Pub in Olympia, WA

We're changing it up this month! Join us as we welcome professionals who live, work or do business in the Olympia area to meet each other and network over delicious food and some of the best beer selection in town!

Been stuck trying to solve a problem in software development or  you just want to talk about some of the latest tools and technologies? Then bring your laptop as this may be a great opportunity to pick someone's brains and bounce around ideas!

We will meet directly at the Fish Tale Brew Pub in downtown Olympia (7:00pm-9:00pm) so bring your appetite and your business cards!
