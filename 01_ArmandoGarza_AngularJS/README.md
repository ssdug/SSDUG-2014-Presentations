AngularJS Presentatiâ€‹on with Armando Garza
========================

######Presented on January 9th 2014 @ the Olympia Center in Olympia, WA

Join us Thursday, January 9th at 7:00pm as we explore AngularJS! The presentation will guide you through aspects of Angular, ranging from setup to out-of-the box functionality and extending the framework.

What is AngularJS? AngularJS is a JavaScript framework for building web applications with HTML, JavaScript and CSS. It offers powerful data-binding, dependency injection, guidelines for structuring your app and other useful goodies to make your webapp testable and maintainable.

HTML is great for declaring static documents, but it falters when we try to use it for declaring dynamic views in web-applications. AngularJS lets you extend HTML vocabulary for your application. The resulting environment is extraordinarily expressive, readable, and quick to develop.
