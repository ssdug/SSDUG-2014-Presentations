######Presented on March 13th 2014 @ the Olympia Center in Olympia, WA

MicroServices. They're not exactly new, but they do seem to be growing in popularity. So what is it? What are some of the problems it solves? What are some of the new challenges it creates? Is it the right approach for us?

Developer, speaker and troublemaker Mike Ibarra ([@bm2yogi](http://twitter.com/bm2yogi)) will explore these questions and others.

Mike is a senior consultant with ThoughtWorks and an organizer of the Seattle Software Craftsmanship Community.
