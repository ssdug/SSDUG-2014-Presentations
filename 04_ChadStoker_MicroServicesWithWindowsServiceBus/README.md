========================

######Presented on April 10th 2014 @ the Olympia Center in Olympia, WA

Chad Stoker will dive deeper into working with Micro Services Architecture and workflow management utilizing Windows Service Bus. Windows Service Bus has an API that is now in parity with the more commonly marketed Azure Service Bus. So it makes development and training opportunities a bit easier to manage. However, it will also allow you to take your code, and push it out to the Azure cloud with minimal impact! Come see how RESTful interactions work with this new platform. We'll look at topics like polling-vs-push notifications, rule implementation & configuration, strategies for administering an on-premise Service Bus, and how your existing applications can leverage it.
